# takeUforward-A2Z-Solutions
Comprehensive solutions to the TUF (takeUforward) A2Z DSA Sheet and Striver's SDE Sheet. Implemented in [Your Language, e.g., C++/Java] with optimized time and space complexities.
# TUF A2Z DSA Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems from the **takeUforward (TUF) A2Z DSA Sheet** curated by **Striver**. 

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms and track my progress through the roadmap.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Platform:** [takeUforward](https://takeuforward.org)
- **Language:** [Enter your language here, e.g., C++ / Java / Python]
- **Focus:** Problem-solving, Time & Space Complexity optimization.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by the sections defined in the sheet:
- `01-Basics/`
- `02-Sorting/`
- `03-Arrays/`
- `04-Binary-Search/`
- ... (and so on)

## 📊 Progress Tracker
- [x] Step 1: Learn the Basics
- [x] Step 2: Learn Important Sorting Techniques
- [ ] Step 3: Solve Problems on Arrays
- [ ] Step 4: Binary Search

## 🛠️ How to use
Each file contains the solution to a specific problem. Most solutions include:
1. The problem link.
2. The logic/approach used.
3. Time and Space complexity analysis.
